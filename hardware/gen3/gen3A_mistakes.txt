> bunch of packges were incompatible with the parts we ordered. especially diodes.
	> kicker/ U$1 flyback
	> kicker/ C5
	> motor/ zener
> should have done copper pours on both sides, especially for heat dissipation. vias only help if they're actually connected to something on the other side.
> make everything 90 or 45 degrees. these look so ugly...
